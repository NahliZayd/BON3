**BON3: Automated Minecraft Mod Deobfuscation with Linkie**

As an enthusiast of Minecraft modding, I present to you "BON3," a Python script designed to automate the deobfuscation process for Minecraft Forge mods. Inspired by the now-defunct "bon2" tool, which enabled deobfuscation using MCP mappings, BON3 leverages the power of "Linkie" developed by Shedaniel to streamline the deobfuscation process in the absence of MCPBot.

**Features:**
- Simplifies the process of deobfuscating Minecraft Forge mods.
- Integrates with the Linkie tool to retrieve accurate mappings for obfuscated code.
- Frees mod developers from manually performing deobfuscation, saving time and effort.
- Supports various Minecraft versions (e.g., 1.8.9, 1.19.2) by allowing the user to specify the target version.
- Ensures precise code transformation, replacing obfuscated variable names with their corresponding readable names.
- Perfect for modders looking to transition smoothly from the MCPBot era.

**Acknowledgments:**

A special thank you to Shedaniel for developing the incredible "Linkie" tool, which forms the backbone of BON3's deobfuscation process.
Heartfelt appreciation to the team behind "http://www.javadecompilers.com/" for providing an essential tool that prepares mods for seamless deobfuscation.

**Usage:**
1. Decompile your Minecraft mod using "http://www.javadecompilers.com/" to prepare it for deobfuscation.
2. Run BON3 and provide the root directory containing your mod's source code.
3. Enter the desired Minecraft version in the format x.y.z (e.g., 1.19.2).
4. Watch as BON3 automates the deobfuscation process, utilizing Linkie's capabilities to retrieve accurate mappings.
5. Enjoy a deobfuscated mod with improved readability and maintainability.


Say goodbye to manual deobfuscation and welcome the streamlined and automated approach provided by BON3. Give your Minecraft mod development a boost with this efficient and time-saving tool. Fork the repository, share it with your fellow modders, and enjoy a smoother coding experience!
